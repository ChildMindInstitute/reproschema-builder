This includes sports or dance that make you sweat or make your legs feel tired, or games\nthat make you breathe hard, like tag, skipping, running, climbing, and others.\nRemember:\n1. There are no right and wrong answers â this is not a test.\n2. Please answer all the questions as honestly and accurately as you can â this is very\nimportant. "
